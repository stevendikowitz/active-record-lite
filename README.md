# ActiveRecordLite

This project is my own lite version of Rail's [ActiveRecord][ActiveRecord]. I did this project to better understand how ActiveRecord actually works: how ActiveRecord automates mapping between classes and tables, attributes and columns and implements object relational associations.

## How to use

I've created a minidatabase for testing. First, head to the project directory in your terminal. After running `bundle install` run the following command to initialize the sqlite3 database:
`cat pokemons.sql | sqlite3 pokemons.db`

Have fun poking around.
